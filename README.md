# Django Tutorial

This repository contains my work through the following [online tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBzwzrDvZ18&t=19745s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) with some additional work that I've done myself.

It contains some very basic apps which I list and explain below.

## MyApp
This app was conceived as a practice of the basic Django features, so it has a lot of unrelated functionality and might be a bit chaotic. The app allows user sign up, login and logout from the home page. There is a mock members table where anyone can add, delete or edit members. There will also be a true member list which only logged in user can see, with actual usernames.

## Blog

This a very simple blog where I can make posts as an admin. I also allow comments from anyone. The email field is optional. The comments need to be approved by an admin (not because I believe in censorship but because I wanted to try this feature).

## WeatherApp

## RealtimeApp
